### Introduction
  Okay so this was a struggle for me obviously...So I had to change my intitial plan for my site to this one. I didn't like having to do this but it was a learning expierence and I did enjoy making this. It is something that I am proud of even if it wasn't entirely planned.

### Sooo...
  So this site is way different than the sketch. This is due to the personal troubles I have been having throughout the semester that have seriously impacted my academic life. I do not want to say too much, but it is the reason why this is late, why I haven't been able to commit as much to this class as I wanted to, and I can only hope this will be accepted even if its only for a few points. I understand fully why if not. I just wanted to finish what I started even if it's not what I envisioned.

### Building

  So this parallax was a real booger! I really did have an issure with laying the images out correctly. And it doesn't help that I wanted everything perfect! However, after looking through some resources I was able to fix most of the problems I was having. Except for the fixed navigation bar. I am a bit disappointed in that. But the rest of the site I am more than happy with!

### Last

  I put most of this together in the last day and a half...before this I had no access to my computer or internet. Like I previously said I had a very impactful personal life incident that has been reoccuring this semester. It isn't the best it could be but it is still something I do take pride in and will continue to build on. Thank you for a great pool of knowledge and skill set that will be utilized in the future for so many things. Have a great summer!
