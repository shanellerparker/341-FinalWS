    <h1>Beads!</h1>
    <p>I love beads and everything to do with them. They are so versitile. However, they are not equal. Each different technique of beadwork usually uses a different type of bead.</p>

  <p>These beads are very similar to their larger counter parts, Czech. They are the best for  projects that require fine detail. They are also economical, but are more limited in color than Czech beads.</p>
  <h2>Czech</h2>

  <p>These beads are by far the most common beads used in flatwork applique beadwork. They have a wide variety of colors and cuts. Another plus is they are also the most economical. However, they are not uniform so they do not work well for peyote stitch or brick stitch. Also some of the finishes offered in some colors wear off quickly!</p>

  <p>These beads are great for peyote! They offer the most uniform shape for an even design. They also have an interior similar to Czech, which means they do not cut through thread as badly as Delicas. They can also be used for larger flatwork projects!</p>
  <h2>Delicas</h2>
  <div class="image">

    <p>These beads are best used for brick stitch,peyote stitch, small geometric flatwork due to their uniform shape and wide opening. However, they tend to cut through thread so thick thread and extra wax is recomended!</p>

    <h1>Beadwork</h1>
    <p>Here are some of my previous finished pieces of beadwork. I included pieces that I have done with Czech and Charolette beads. The other two are with Delica's that a close friend of mine completed. Beading is part of what keeps out friendship strong. We help each other with our weaknesses and teach each other constantly.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey! I'm Shanelle. I've been beading every since I was young. My Yaya?(grandma in Salish) was the one who taught me how to bead. She taught me the various techniques of this traditional artform. I her to thank for this...it is why I dedicated the name of this page to her, Mali is Mary in Salish. Then Telpa, which was her mother's maiden name. It translates to 'kills in the lodge'. Beading is my passion and I love to share it with everyone!</p>
